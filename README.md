###
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MongoDB, PostgreSQL and TypeScript.

  - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a CRM+ERP system(React+Laravel+MaterialUI), and a book management system(React+.NETCoreAPI+AntDesign), all outside of work.

  - Pronouns: Laravel, .NET Core, C#, Redis, React, Vue.

  - âš¡ Fun fact: All my contributions done outside of working hours. So that's the reason why my contribution count is low. Either my workplaces hosts Git on their local servers or not using it at all(SVN). Below chart doesn't include private repos, includes only the public repositories' stats. 
  
  By the way I don't care about what i put on my public repos. I'm using public repos for learning purposes.
