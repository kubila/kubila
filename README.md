   - I like to learn new things, especially flowing around web. Hanging out with Laravel, .NET Core, Redis, React, Vue on my spare time. 
  
  - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, one of its machine learning libraries and Django will be the next objective.
  
  Below chart doesn't include private repos, includes only the public repositories' stats. 
  
  By the way I don't care about what i put on my public repos. I'm using public repos for learning purposes.
