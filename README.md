  <b>  
   I like to learn new things, especially flowing around web. Hanging out with Laravel, .NET Core, Redis, React, Vue on my spare time.
  </b>
  
  I will learn Python and one of its machine learning libraries next.
  
  Below chart doesn't include private repos, includes only the public repositories' stats. 
  
  By the way I don't care about what i put on my public repos. I'm using public repos for learning purposes, so no need to finish them.
