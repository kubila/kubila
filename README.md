### Hi there, 
I'm an; animal lover,
interested in many topics and a curious learner. 
I like to learn new things, especially flowing around web.
<!--

#Iâ€™m currently working on a CRM+ERP system(React+Laravel+MaterialUI), and a book management system(React+.NETCoreAPI+AntDesign), all outside of work.
**kubila/kubila** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...

 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MongoDB, React Native. I'll focus on React from now on, no need for another JS framework.

  - ðŸ”­ I'll be on vacation this summer, so contribution count will be low.

  - Pronouns: Laravel, .NET Core, C#, Redis, React, Vue. I use SQL on almost every project (PostgreSQL or SQL Server or MariaDB).

  - âš¡ Fun fact: All my contributions done outside of working hours. So that's the reason why my contribution count is low. Either my workplaces host Git on their local servers or not using it at all(SVN). Below chart doesn't include private repos, includes only the public repositories' stats.

  -   I'm in the middle of workplace changing process.
  
  By the way I don't care about what i put on my public repos. I'm using public repos for learning purposes.
